# About lehmanc25 
I'm orginally from Weston Mass. and I'm a member of both the football and track teams here at W&L. I'm studying both CS and Business and interested in careers in Finance, Sales and Trading, or Technology. Working on app development or something to do with AI would also be pretty cool.
